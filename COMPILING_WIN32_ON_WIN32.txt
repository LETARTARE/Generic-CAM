# Compiling on Windows (Visual Studio 2019)

Start Visual Studio 2019.
Check out the repository inside Visual Studios splash screen. Visual Studio registers the project as a CMAKE driven project.
Wait till the imported projects fails. CMAKE reports a CMakeLists.txt:5 (find_package) error. This means,
that the directories for the Libraries (wxWidgets and Lua) have not been set up.
Now open the Project->CMAKE-Settings. After this failed attempt two extra vaiables have been set up here, that contain the value
..._DIR-NOTFOUND. Direct these to to the directories, where wxWidgets_Dev was copied to and the Directory, where Lua was copied to.
