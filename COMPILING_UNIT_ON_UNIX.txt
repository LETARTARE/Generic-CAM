All these instructions assume a native build on linux or for the cross
compilation of a build on linux for windows.

The Linux distribution, this document was written for:
	uname -a
	Linux 4.13.0-39-generic #44~16.04.1-Ubuntu

## Compiling on Linux for Linux

sudo apt-get install cmake

Setup a working directory for compiling the project. cd into that directory and

	cmake [path to base directory of project]
	
E.g. inside the project directory:

	mkdir bin
	cd bin 
	cmake ../.
	make

If everything went well, You should find an executable in this very directory.
