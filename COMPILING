# Compiling and Cross-compiling projects

All these instructions assume a native build on linux or for the cross
compilation of a build on linux for windows.

The Linux distribution, this document was written for:
	uname -a
	Linux 4.13.0-39-generic #44~16.04.1-Ubuntu

## Compiling on Linux for Linux

sudo apt-get install cmake

Setup a working directory for compiling the project. cd into that directory and

	cmake [path to base directory of project]
	
E.g. inside the project directory:

	mkdir bin
	cd bin 
	cmake ../.
	make

If everything went well, You should find an executable in this very directory.

## Cross Compiling on Linux for Windows

Install the cross compiling toolchain with everything it pulls along:

	sudo apt-get install g++-mingw-w64-i686

### Cross compiling wxWidgets

Setup a working directory and copy the sources for the latest stable codebase from

	https://wxwidgets.org/downloads/

Unpack it into some working directory for compiling and installing

I choose the local directory /home/[username]/usr/src/

Unpack the downloaded packet in there. cd into the directory

	~/usr/src/wxWidgets-3.0.4$

wxWidgets uses autotools for building. (configure -> make -> make install)

Configure sets up the makefiles. It is told that we want to comile for a different OS:

	./configure --prefix=/home/[username]/usr/local --build=i686-linux --host=i686-w64-mingw32 --enable-monolithic --disable-debug --enable-opengl --enable-docview --enable-help --enable-optimise

	--prefix: Where everything ends up. Here the directory /home/[username]/usr/local is used.
	--build: Where we are: This is actualy expanded to i686-pc-linux-gnu (cpu-vendor-os)
	--host: Where we are aiming for: i686-w64-mingw32 for 32bit-Windows, x86_64-w64-mingw32 for 64bit-Windows
 
The options for configure can be viewed by invoking ./configure --help
 
If configure complains about missing header or something of that ilk, keep on installing packages until
configure comes back to You with something similar to
 
	Configured wxWidgets 3.0.4 for `i686-w64-mingw32'
 
(It it complains about missing 'magic.h' it does not want 'imagemagic', but 'libmagic-dev': Magic numbers for file types)

	make

If successful followed by

	make install
	
('sudo' not needed, because it is installed locally.)
This will setup the include, bin and lib directories for the cross compiler directory

To rip it back out:
	make uninstall

#### Testing wxWidgets

In the checked out source-code there is a samples folder. The configure script set up the Makefiles in this directory to use
the cross compiler as well.

	cd samples
	
By setting the WINEPATH variable DLLs do not have to be copied around to get the project to work. For shipping 
only some DLLS from /usr/bin/i686-w64-mingw32/lib and /usr/lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/5.3-win32 have to be copied
alongside the program.

	cd minimal
	make
	WINEPATH="/home/[username]/usr/local/lib;/usr/lib/gcc/i686-w64-mingw32/5.3-win32;/usr/i686-w64-mingw32/lib/"
	wine minimal.exe
	
### Cross compiling Lua from Linux to Windows

Download and unpack the Lua sourcecode into /home/[username]/usr/src/
cd into the directory.
The Lua Makefile is not really intended for cross compiling. A lot of variables have to be set manually:

	make mingw install INSTALL_TOP="/home/[username]/usr/local" CC="i686-w64-mingw32-gcc -std=gnu99" AR="i686-w64-mingw32-ar rcu" RANLIB="i686-w64-mingw32-ranlib" INSTALL_EXEC="cp -p" INSTALL_DATA="cp -p" TO_BIN="lua.exe luac.exe" TO_LIB="lua53.dll"

### Cross-Compiling the project itself

Get the source-code. Unpack it into a directory.
cd to the source directory and into a bin subdirectory. Invoke CMAKE with:
	
	cmake -DwxWidgets_ROOT_DIR=/home/[username]/usr/local -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=../Toolchain_Win32.cmake ../.
	make
	
If everything went well, You should find an executable in this very directory.
